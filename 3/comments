Zad 1.
Information Expert - getValueOfGoal all in seperate *FootballGame instead of in FootballMatch

Low Coupling - IFootballGame "abstracts out" even AbstractFootballGame

High Cohesion - TeamOnField only deals with Team instance on a level of
the current match, i.e. only scores can affect them

Polymorphism - evident from AbstractFootballGame and derived

Indirection/Pure fabrication(?) - TeamOnField as "bogus/auxiliary" class

Zad 2.
Analysis:
reportprinter getsData by itself -- depends on the semantics! i.e.
	- if it gets data from some resource that is fixed within the class itself
	and it means pushing that data to inner cache/queue, then OK, but...
	why does it return a String then?! I think it suggests chaining, i.e.
	invoking getData on that fixed resource (which is stupid)
	- if it should be able to get (better word here - receive) data from just
	about any resource, it better had a parameter (of resource type or just
	data(string) type) - but it doesn't have a param... fixed in second version
reportprinter formatsDocument by itself -- violation!
reportprinter printsreport by itself -- OK

Zad 4.
well, Square shouldn't have both width and height because it has sideLength oO

Zad 5.
Connection
at least the following parts should be seperate:
- IConnectionStatements
- IConnectionState
- IConnectionMapping
- IConnectionClientInfo

Zad 6.
Already done in ex. 2 - just substitute ReportComposer with ReportFormatter...
